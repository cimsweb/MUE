Evaluation of LLM models for understanding tasks with numbers.   

Existing benchmarks allow for the assessment of language models' performance in specific domains and for specialized tasks, which is primarily valuable for the developers of these models. However, they do not address the needs of a broader audience of LLM users, who require more universal and adaptive tools.   

In conclusion, directions for future research in the evaluation of language models and the adaptation of evaluation methods to specific tasks. These efforts can contribute to improving the quality of user interaction with LLMs and expanding their applications across various fields.
